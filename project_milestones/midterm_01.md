# CS210: Project Milestone 1 Requirements

The goal of Project Milestone 1 is to ensure familiarity with setting up a GitHub repository and creating a basic commit history. This milestone introduces you to essential skills in version control, which are foundational for collaborative software development.

## Requirements

### 1. Create a New GitHub Repository:
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Create a new repository named: **CS210_Midterm_Project** 
   - The repository can be either public or private:
     - If the repository is private, you must share it with the instructor’s GitHub account.

### 2. Add a README File:
   - Create a new `README.md` file in the repository.
   - The `README.md` file must include the following information:
     - First Name
     - Last Name
   - **Pro tip:** Use Markdown formatting for a professional and clean appearance (e.g., `# Your Name` as a heading).

### 3. Commit History:
   - Ensure there is a clear commit history that shows the addition of your first and last name to the `README.md` file.
   - The commit message should be descriptive (e.g., `Added first and last name to README.md`).

### 4. Share the Repository (if private):
   - If you opted for a private repository, ensure the instructor’s GitHub account `instructor.account.on.github` has been granted access.

## Submission Instructions

### 1. Verify Repository Setup:
   - Ensure the repository meets all requirements listed above.
   - Double-check that the `README.md` file contains your first and last name.

### 2. Submission Link:
   - Submit the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/[username]/CS210_Midterm_Project`) as a text entry.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Commit Messages:** Use meaningful commit messages to clearly describe what changes you made.
- **Repository Visibility:** Public repositories are visible to anyone. If privacy is a concern, choose a private repository and share it with the instructor.
- **Markdown Formatting:** Utilize headings (`#`), lists (`-` or `*`), and other Markdown features to make your `README.md` file well-structured and readable.
- **Sharing a Private Repository:** To share a private repository, go to the repository settings, navigate to *Manage Access*, and add your instructor as a collaborator.
